# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview:
In this project, we are using Python and multiple supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk.

The following machine learning models were evaluated in this process:

* Oversampling: RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
* Undersampling: Cluster Centroids algorithm
* Combination approach of over and undersampling: SMOTEENN algorithm.
* Comparing machine learning models that reduce bias: Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier.
